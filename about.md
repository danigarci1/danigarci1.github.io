Just hit 18 months @ [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). I'm now team lead of the small 'Data Platform & Tools' team within the data group. The team manages the main data monorepo and its build/release, 
owns core data platform pieces like container-orchestration (K8s) and the Data Lake build, and provides core productivity systems like a Notebook environment and batch workflow system. 

Beyond platform responsibilities, I'm increasingly working closer with data scientists and machine learning engineers, leaning more into a role that is sometimes called 'Software Engineering - ML Platform'.

I'm still right into the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system, and now help maintain the [Python rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python) for Bazel. It's the future, get on it.

I just completed the first half of [some more formal education in Mathematics](https://www.handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c11210.html). 
I'm doing it to upskill in Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics so that I may become a self-sufficient machine learning engineer in future, building data-intensive machine learning systems from the ground up.

## *Previously...*

### **May 2019 Edition**

I'm a Backend Software Engineer @ [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) in their Data Engineering team. 
I'm still quite interested in NLP, Knowledge Bases, and Computational Dialectics, but now regularly find myself
exploring the world of the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system. 

Major surgery on my right leg has had me off my feet for six months now, so I've spent most of my free time stationary, either
[reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88184044-jonathon-belotti) or coding ðŸ™‚. 


### Jan 2018 Edition

I am a Software Engineering student at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne. I've previously interned with [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) on their [Answer Bot](https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/) product, and at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) as an application developer in their reliability/monitoring team.
I'm currently shopping around for graduate software engineering positions starting after November 2018.

I'm currently also doing a lot of work building developer communities around my University. I'll chase any opportunity to improve collaboration and outreach in the tech. industry.

My main areas of interest are in NLP, Knowledge Bases, and Computational Dialectics.
